### dataset：Iris

### assignment：

**1**. Pick two classes of data (two species of Iris) and two features from the four in the Iris dataset, so that the data for two species are linearly separable.

（1）Apply the Perceptron and Adaline models to the classes/feature and report your results.

（2）Use using three features at a time.

（3）using all four features at the same time.
